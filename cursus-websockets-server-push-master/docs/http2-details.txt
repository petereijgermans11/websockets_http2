HTTP/2

Binary Framing: transparent
Stream Multiplexing: transparent
Prioritisation: ?
Server Push: exposed to applications
Upgrade from HTTP 1.1: transparent?

is binary, instead of textual
is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
can therefore use one connection for parallelism
uses header compression to reduce overhead
allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client cache

HTTP/1.x has a problem called “head-of-line blocking,” where effectively only one request can be outstanding on a connection at a time.

page: 80 assets & each request has 1400B headers: 7-8 round trips to get the headers out “on the wire" because of TCP’s Slow Start mechanism

Does HTTP/2 require encryption? No. After extensive discussion, the Working Group did not have consensus to require the use of encryption (e.g., TLS) for the new protocol. However, some implementations have stated that they will only support HTTP/2 when it is used over an encrypted connection

HTTP/2 over TLS: h2
HTTP/2 over TCP: h2c
